    I am a recent graduate in the data science program who is equipped with a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and python programming experience. I am a person really enjoys solving technically challenging problems. Eagerness to solve and passion to summarize the understanding from this process enables me to have an in-depth understanding of whatever I touch. 

    I already got my EAD card and my OPT will start on Feb 14, 2022. I will be really glad to show my passion if there is a possible conversation with you.
